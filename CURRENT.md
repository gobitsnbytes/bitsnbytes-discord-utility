## 🎙️ Feature 9: chrono — Meeting Scheduler & Voice Agent

### Description
Exposes a web scheduling portal (`chrono` hosted at `cal.gobnb.org`) for members to book sync sessions, links bookings with Cal.com/Google Calendar, provisions temporary Discord Voice Channels, plays legal consent warnings, records the audio, transcribes it with Gemini, and delivers formatted briefs. Also includes a meeting landing/reschedule interface, contributor instant meeting launcher, Web Push notification architecture, and Discord avatar synchronization.

### Key Workflows
1. **Web Scheduler Portal (`cal.gobnb.org`):**
   - Built with raw responsive HTML/JS and Svelte-like Vanilla CSS in `public/style.css` matching Vercel/Linear dark aesthetics.
   - Supports display titles, custom bios, timezone configurations, and weekly availability selectors.
   - Provides a multi-host selection system (combining schedules for multiple leads) and custom meeting durations.
   - Enforces Discord OAuth2 authentication for all guest bookings, automatically adding them to the server (via `guilds.join` scope), resolving their Discord IDs, and locking pre-filled details.
   - Implements database-backed session cookie persistence (`web_sessions` table) to withstand bot restarts, along with Express `trust proxy` configuration and dynamic secure cookie handling for Nginx reverse proxies.
   - Implements direct "⚡ Request Instant Meet" buttons triggering direct Discord DMs with interactive Accept/Decline action controls.
   - **Discord Avatar Integration:** Extracts the user's avatar image hash during OAuth authentication, saves it to `user_availability` and session tables, and displays high-quality Discord profile photos on the scheduler cards.
2. **Meeting Landing Page (`/m/{meet-code}`):**
   - Implements a Google Meet-style unique room locator (`xyz-abcd-pqr`) stored securely in Turso DB.
   - Features a custom developer-themed landing UI with:
     - Real-time details (title, host names, start time, description).
     - Active participant avatars and names.
     - Live voice channel member polling to show who is currently inside the VC.
     - Direct "Join Voice Channel" launcher linking directly to the Discord app client.
3. **Meeting Rescheduler:**
   - Adds a "Reschedule Meeting" interface directly on the meeting landing card.
   - Allows either the meeting host (`creator_id`) or the meeting booker (`booked_by`, including external guest users) to reschedule the meeting to a different slot up to a maximum limit of **3 times**.
   - Enforces slot availability checks, validates the reschedule limit, and registers the reschedule reason.
   - Triggers automated notifications to all attendees across multiple channels:
     - **Web Push Notifications:** Real-time system banners delivered to users who opted-in.
     - **Discord DMs:** Rich embeds listing the change, reason, and a direct meeting page link.
     - **SMTP Email:** Fully structured HTML emails showing the old/new times, reason, and a join CTA.
4. **Instant Meeting Launcher:**
   - Features an "⚡ Instant Meeting" provisioning section on the scheduling homepage (visible only to authenticated contributors).
   - Allows users to type a title and set the scope:
     - `Open`: Anyone on the server can join the provisioned voice channel.
     - `Invite-only`: Restricted to invited hosts and guests.
   - Automatically provisions the voice channel, DMs all invitees with an active join alert, and outputs a shareable meeting page URL.
5. **Discord Voice Provisioning:**
   - Automatically provisions a temporary VC channel under the `EVENTS` category.
   - Explicitly adds the bot client ID to channel overrides to prevent voice lockout during E2E encryption handshakes.
   - Triggers voice join callbacks that announce meeting commencement and self-starts the audio recorder.
6. **Legal Recording Consent:**
   - Plays audio warning notices (in English and Hindi) on VC join.
   - Features a safety timeout of `90_000` ms to ensure long text notices are not cut off.
   - Sends direct text notices to late joiners in the VC chat with language translation toggle buttons.
7. **Recording & Gemini Transcription:**
   - Subscribes to Opus audio streams, decodes, and records audio packets with valid header CRC checksums to prevent FFmpeg mismatches.
   - Merges separate speaker segments, uploads them to the Google File API, and utilizes `gemini-3.5-flash` to extract a speaker-labeled Hinglish/English transcript and JSON briefs.
8. **DM Briefs Delivery:**
   - Matches invitee and host emails to registered Discord profiles and registers them in database tables.
   - Formats a summary, key decisions, and action items inside a Discord Embed and DMs it directly to all attendees along with the full transcript as a `.txt` file attachment.

### Commands

#### `/meet-schedule`
View or generate booking links to schedule sync sessions.

#### `/meet-start`
Manually mark a meeting as active, DM any missing invitees, and start recording immediately.

#### `/meet-transcript`
Query the database for past sync sessions and retrieve/DM meeting notes.

## 📋 Feature 10: Dynamic Action-Item Tracker (Close the Loop)

### Description
Extracts action items from meeting transcript briefs generated by Gemini, resolves assignee names to Discord Snowflake IDs, registers them in a local SQLite/remote Turso database, pings the assignee via a Discord DM with interactive buttons ("Mark Completed" / "Dismiss"), and updates task status dynamically upon button clicks.

### Key Workflows
1. **Gemini Brief Action Items extraction:**
   - Extracts structured action items (task details, assignees, deadlines) from transcript data.
2. **Assignee Name Resolution:**
   - Multi-layer fuzzy matcher resolves assignee strings to Discord user IDs via:
     - Meeting speakers voice activity map.
     - Scheduled meeting attendees directory.
     - Guild-wide cache and members query search.
3. **Task Registration & DM Notification:**
   - Registers each action item in the `action_items` SQL database table.
   - For users successfully mapped to Discord IDs, sends a DM embed containing task details, deadline, and interactive action buttons.
4. **Interactive Action buttons:**
   - Captures button interaction events (`action_item_complete_` and `action_item_dismiss_`) via `events/interactionCreate.js`.
   - Validates authorization (only the assignee can update the status).
   - Marks the task status as `completed` or `dismissed` in the DB and updates the DM embed in real-time, disabling the buttons.

### Files
- `lib/meetingsDb.js` - SQLite schema migration, indices, database operations (`createActionItem`, `getActionItemsForUser`, `updateActionItemStatus`, `getActionItem`).
- `lib/transcriptionPipeline.js` - User ID fuzzy resolution, DM builder and delivery triggers.
- `events/interactionCreate.js` - Interactive DM button handling and visual updates.
- `tests/actionItems.test.js` - Integration and database unit tests verifying status transitions and unauthorized user rejection.

## 📝 Recent Bug Fixes

| Date | Bug | Fix |
|------|-----|-----|
| 2026-06-03 | Codebase Overhaul & Stability Patches | Conducted full security/logic audits. Added atomic transaction support, resolved database migration race conditions, integrated middleware auth on API/dashboard routes, removed unreachable gamification code, resolved unit test errors, and cleaned up dead files. |
| 2026-06-03 | Action-Item Tracker Integration | Added SQLite action_items table, DM notification delivery, fuzzy resolution, and interactive buttons with authorization validation. |
| 2026-05-31 | Voice/VC Joining & Recording Failures | Added a 2-minute empty channel debounce grace period to prevent instant meeting cleanup/deletion. Added automatic reconnection recovery for voice bots when humans join/remain in the VC (maintaining the 2-human threshold requirement). |
| 2026-05-31 | VC & meeting start crashes | Fixed a crash in meeting start/auto-commence notifications by making `findMeetingByTempChannel` populate `meeting.attendees` and `meeting.externalEmails` correctly (mirroring `getMeeting` behavior). Added robust defensive checks to `resolveAttendeeUserIds` and tagging routines to completely prevent undefined map exceptions. |
| 2026-05-30 | Role Reaction Mismatch | Reverted mapping of `💻` to `dev` in `lib/roles.js` to keep the public `dev` interest role separate from the official team track `tech` role, and updated `events/messageReactionAdd.js` to automatically create interest roles (like `dev`) in the guild if they are missing. |
| 2026-05-27 | Scoping Flaw & Category Hardening | Restricted "Open" scoped meeting VCs to the general contributor role, resolved meetings category by ID (1490416248000090122) first, and tightened the category's default permission overrides to prevent leaks to @everyone |
